# DevOps Project

This project demonstrates the integration of various DevOps tools to create a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline. The tools used include Terraform, Jenkins, SonarQube, Artifactory, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm. Additionally, a sample Java and Maven project is included.

## Architecture

1. **Terraform**: Used for infrastructure as code to provision the necessary cloud infrastructure.
2. **Jenkins**: Automates the CI/CD pipeline.
3. **SonarQube**: Performs static code analysis to ensure code quality.
4. **Artifactory**: Manages binary repositories.
5. **Ansible**: Manages configuration and deployment tasks.
6. **Docker**: Containerizes applications.
7. **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
8. **Helm**: Manages Kubernetes applications using Helm charts.
